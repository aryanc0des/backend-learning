# 🛠️ Backend Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my backend development learning journey!  
This repository tracks my progress as I learn backend concepts, build projects, and document everything along the way.

## 📚 What I'm Learning
I'm following the **Chai aur Code (Hitesh Choudhary) Backend Playlist** and expanding further through documentation, blogs, and hands-on projects.

Topics I’ll be covering:
- Node.js & npm
- Express.js
- REST APIs
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, Cookies, Sessions)
- MVC Architecture
- Environment Variables & Configuration
- Error Handling & Logging
- File Uploads & Cloud Storage
- Deployment (Render / Railway / AWS)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong understanding of how backend systems work
- Create production-ready APIs
- Deploy real-world applications
- Maintain clean and structured code practices
